# Low Input Epigenomics

### 9–16 May 2025, Wellcome Genome Campus, UK

[Wellcome Connecting Science Course Run Website](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/low-input-epigenomics-20250509/) <br />

### Summary

Our understanding of eukaryotic genomes has benefitted tremendously from whole genome sequencing projects. However, we are only beginning to systematically understand how the interplay of DNA, proteins and, biochemical modifications (i.e. chromatin) can influence global processes which control gene expression, mRNA splicing, and DNA replication or repair in normal development and disease states.

This hands-on practical course provides training in some of the experimental and computational approaches that may be used to mechanically dissect important aspects of chromatin biology at the gene and genome-wide levels in rare cell populations.

**What will this course cover?**

Attendees will receive intensive wet laboratory and computational training using various state-of-the-art methods requiring fewer than a thousand cells input. This bridges the gap between the standard bulk epigenomic approaches, often requiring inputs of millions of cells, and emerging but costly single-cell techniques. The content will include design, laboratory, and analytical aspects of: 

- Cleavage under targets and release using nucleases (CUT&RUN) and Cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) to profile histone marks and transcription factor binding.
- Low-C to map the 3D structure of the genome and interactions between regulatory elements and gene promoters.
- Omni-ATAC to assess chromatin accessibility.
- Computational methods using various pipelines to analyse low-input genomic data and visualisation.

**Who should attend this course?**

This course is open to senior PhD students, early career postdoctoral scientists, or junior faculty members who wish to interrogate epigenomic features on a low input scale from anywhere in the world.

### Learning outcomes

**After completing this course, you will be able to:**

- Perform CUT&RUN, CUT&Tag, Omni-ATAC, and Low-C techniques, including experimental design, endpoint analysis and validation (qPCR, TapeStation)
- Apply genome sequencing methods for low input genomic analysis
- Perform end-to-end analysis of low input genome sequence data from raw sequence to identifying loci of biological importance
- Explain how low input genomic methods can be applied in development and disease research

### Programme

The course will cover the following techniques:

- CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag to profile histone marks and transcription factor binding
- Low-C to map the 3D structure of the genome
- Omni-ATAC to assess chromatin accessibility
- End-point analysis using qPCR and Tape station techniques
- Computational analysis of low input gene level and genome-wide data to determine the interplay of DNA, proteins and - chromatin modifications in biological processes

These sessions will be supplemented with pre-course training on Linux and UNIX basics, hands-on tutorials and demonstrations, and guest seminars from global experts. Attendees will also have the opportunity to discuss their research interests and present aspects of their own work relevant to the course during a poster session.
